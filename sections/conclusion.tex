Building a secure system demands an understanding of potential threats and their 
underlying root causes.
%
We conducted the first study that analyzes the security of the \eos system,
which has recently become one of the most popular blockchain systems. We 
presented three novel attack methods along with one concrete attack scenario, 
abusing the controversial \eos design policy. All the attacks exploit new
system components, including \cpu, \ram, and BP scheduling, which are unique to 
\eos. We also conducted the experiments for each attack, thereby demonstrating
their severities. 
%
Finally, we proposed the possible mitigations of the presented threats.

In this paper, we manually checked several smart contracts whether they are
vulnerable to the presented attacks. However, we believe there still exist
other vulnerable SCs that have yet to be discovered. We leave finding vulnerable \eos
SCs on a larger scale as a promising future work.
